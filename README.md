## 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm **Swift**, a web developer focused on building modern, scalable web applications that solve real problems.

I care about:
- clean, readable code  
- performance and scalability  
- simple solutions over over-engineering  
- good user experience  

I work comfortably across the stack and enjoy shipping things that actually work in production.
